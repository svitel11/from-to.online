                    This information may be in the form of text documents, images, audio clips, software programs, or other types of data.<br>
                    Computer data may be processed by the computer's CPU and is stored in files and folders on the computer's hard disk.
                    At its most rudimentary level, computer data is a bunch of ones and zeros, known as binary data.<br>
                    Because all computer data is in binary format, it can be created, processed, saved, and stored digitally.
                    This allows data to be transferred from one computer to another using a network connection or various media devices.
                    It also does not deteriorate over time or lose quality after being used multiple times.</span>
